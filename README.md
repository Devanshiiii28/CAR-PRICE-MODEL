Car Price Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning and Linear Regression
Goal: Predict the price of a car based on various features using supervised machine learning with linear regression.

In supervised learning, we have labeled data that contains both the input features and the corresponding output labels (in this case, car prices). Linear regression is a simple algorithm that tries to model the relationship between the input variables (features) and the target variable (car price) by fitting a straight line to the data.

Steps for Car Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
Data Collection

Collect data that contains car features like make, model, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and price (target variable).
You can find datasets like these from sources such as:
Kaggle Car Price Prediction Dataset
Cars Dataset
Data Preprocessing

Import necessary libraries.
Load the dataset.
Handle missing values (e.g., remove or fill missing data).
Convert categorical variables (e.g., make, model, fuel type) into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Normalize/scale numerical data to make the model more efficient.
Splitting the Data:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (usually an 80/20 split).
Model Building:

Import the Linear Regression model from a library like Scikit-learn.
Train the model on the training set.
Model Evaluation:

Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared to evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
Prediction:

Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict car prices for new data.
